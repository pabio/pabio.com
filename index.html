				<p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
					Dear friends of Pabio, with a heavy heart, we have to say goodbye to
					you today. Following a difficult year, we are now faced with the
					unfortunate necessity to declare bankruptcy for Pabio (Koj AG).
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					When Anand and I founded Pabio in 2020, our goal was nothing less than
					to revolutionize modern living and make high-quality living spaces
					affordable and accessible to all. We were able to enjoy steady growth
					from day one and, over the past three years, have been able to set up
					more than a hundred apartments in Switzerland and Germany, providing
					our customers with a beautiful home.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					Our business model was heavily dependent on our financing partner:
					they enabled us to purchase the furniture and pass it on to our
					customers as a monthly subscription. Without proper funding,
					unfortunately, it is not possible to continue our business.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					Towards the end of last year, our financing partner unexpectedly
					stopped issuing loans, a consequence of the global economic crisis and
					rising interest rates. Unfortunately, we were not informed about this
					early, which put us under immense time pressure. Despite our strenuous
					attempts to secure alternative funding solutions, we were unable to
					overcome this hurdle, and regretfully acknowledge that it is not
					feasible to continue our operations under the present conditions.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					Until the last moment, we did everything in our power to save Pabio.
					There were already advanced negotiations with an interested buyer from
					Germany. Unfortunately, these talks failed due to the lack of approval
					from our financing partner. Against this backdrop, we are now forced
					to file for bankruptcy. This step is not an easy one for any of us and
					we deeply regret it. The entire Pabio team has worked tirelessly
					around the clock to turn our vision into reality.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					I would like to thank all of our customers, suppliers and investors
					from the bottom of my heart for their support. You have been an
					integral part of our vision and your trust has been, and continues to
					be, our greatest motivation and inspiration. I, along with the entire
					Pabio team, am deeply grateful to you.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-6">
					Carlo Badini<br />
					Founder, Pabio (Koj AG)
